My 3-month journey into Data Science (Mayâ€“August 2025)

## ðŸ“… Day 1: 27 May 2025

### Topics Covered:
- What is Data Science?
- Python setup and basic syntax
- Variables and Data Types
- Lists and Loops
- Functions
- Dictionaries

---

### Practical Tasks Done:
- Created variables with `int`, `float`, `string`, and `bool` data types
- Wrote a loop to square a list of numbers
- Created a BMI function using parameters and return values
- Built and updated a dictionary to store personal profile info

---

### Key Learnings & Reflections:
- Mastered core Python building blocks essential for Data Science
- Learned how to debug a `KeyError` caused by a typo in dictionary keys
- Practiced clean and readable code formatting
- Realized the importance of accuracy in syntax and naming

---

### Output Code Samples:
```python
profile = {
    "name": "Sayam Warsi",
    "age": 19,
    "programming skills": ["coding", "debugging"]
}

profile["programming skills"].append("Data Science")
print(profile["name"])
print(profile["programming skills"])
